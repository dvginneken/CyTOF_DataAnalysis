# CyTOF Data Analysis
*Author: Daphne van Ginneken*  
  
Welcome to the GitHub repository were the scripts used to complete my bachelor thesis are stored.
All scripts are written in R 4.0.2
  
The computational part of this research consists of 3 components:  
## 1. Preprocessing
These scripts form a pipeline which preprocesses raw CyTOF samples.  
## 2. Single Feature Analysis
After the preprocessed CyTOF samples are clustered, these scripts will analyze the association between the clusters and certain features.
## 3. Age Prediction
A machine learning algorithm to predict ages based on a relative frequency table.
