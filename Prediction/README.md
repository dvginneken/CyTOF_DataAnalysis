# Age Prediction
These scripts contain a machine learning algorithm to predict age based on a relative frequency table of cluster percentages. This algorithm uses a nested cross fold validation for hyperparameter selection. See the workflow at the end of this file for a detailed description of the algorithm.

## Input Data
This algorithm works on a relative frequency table of the percentage of cells each sample has in a cluster. Each row of the table represents
