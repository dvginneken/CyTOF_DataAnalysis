# Single Feature Analysis
After clustering the preprocessed data the association between each cluster and age is analyzed with:
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA.R)
* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE.R)

The trajectory of the lineages (T cells, B cells, Myeloid cells and Natural Killer Cells) are analyzed with the script: Lineage_Percentages.R
